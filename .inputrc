# Key bindings for Bash by Wincent Colaiuta
# Created 4 December 2003

# corresponds to "\033[3~" in the Terminal keyboard settings window
"\e[3~": delete-char

set bell-style visible

# by default, if filename completion is performed on a symbolic link pointing
# to a directory, append a slash
set mark-symlinked-directories

# word movement (normally M-f, M-b, but can't use Meta on a Spanish keyboard
# without losing the ability to type important keys like: \ @ â‚¬ [ ] { } )
# as a result, setting these here has no effect: must paste
# "\033b" and "\033f" into the Terminal keyboard settings window
#"\M-[D": backward-word
#"\M-[C": forward-word

# Control-A and Control-E are the defaults here (and continue to work)
# but Control-Left and Control-Right are a bit more pleasant to use
# Must also configure the Terminal to send "\033[5D" and "\033[5C"
# for Control-Left and Control-Right respectively, otherwise readline
# will never see these keystrokes:
"\e[5D": beginning-of-line
"\e[5C": end-of-line

# Hit ESC repeatedly to cycle through possible completions (ProjectBuilder)
#ESC: menu-complete
# bug: can hit ESC to choose completion, but on pressing return key, only
# the text entered up until the time of the ESC key press is actually used
# or a previous completion is used rather than the currently displayed one
# also, you have to hit ESC twice in order for it to work

# Hit tab to show a list of possible completions, ignoring case
set completion-ignore-case
set show-all-if-ambiguous
set visible-stats

# Search history for commands matching text typed so far:
# bug.. if you find a match, delete a few characters and hit up/down again
# you get a literal up key "]" printed to the shell

# you can also trip a bug by hitting the "end" of the history buffer in
# either direction

# - using the Up/Down arrow keys
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# forward delete
"\e[3~": delete-char

# enable 8-bit input (do not strip 8th bit from input)
set meta-flag

# synonym for meta-flag
set input-meta

# display 8-bit characters directly (rather than as a meta-prefixed escape sequence)
set output-meta

# do not convert 8-bit characters into ASCII key sequences
set convert-meta off

# experimenting with vi editing mode
#set editing-mode vi
